    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Welcome to The Minecraft Stalker. A website created by StalkerGlock, a minecraft creator looking to share his works. Here you'll find updates on projects, social media links, trailers and world downloads. Currently this site was only made with desktop compataibility in mind, sorry for the inconvenance.</p>

    <h2>Content</h2>
    <p>In the Downloads page you'll find free world downloads, trailers and images and other types and forms of media. Sooner or later I also plan on implementing some form(s) of monetization such as a select few paid world downloads or ads, however for the time being this isn't the case.</p>
